# **About**

<p class="about">In Bancolombia we believe open source is responsible for the development of most modern technologies due to its advantages during the development process like speed, security, innovation, lower costs and knowledge interchange, which is why we are constantly trying to contribute to different open source projects and create our own so that everyone else, not only our employees can use them and contribute.</p>

<p class="about">With this website we are trying to get more people to know what we are currently working on so that our projects can benefit from others knowledge. Also, we show some of the Medium posts that some of the members of the organization have written.</p>
